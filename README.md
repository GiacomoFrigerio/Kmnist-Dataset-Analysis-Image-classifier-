# KmnistAnalysis
KMNIST dataset analysis

PVML Library (https://github.com/claudio-unipv/pvml)
For training (train_cnn.py, train_mlp.py) 
For data analysis (evaluation.py, evaluationPCA.py,  data_analysis.py, identification.py, identificationVisualize.py, accuracy.py )

In Keras Library there are: 

- examples of PCA and its visualization (effect on image and visualization of eigenvalues).
- CNN architecture and KNN method
- Autoencoder (inspired by https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/autoencoder?hl=it) for Reconstruction of Images and Noise Cleaning
